Personal Proxy Server

Author : Chaitanya Kuber

This script was first developed by Jonathan Lumb who can be
contacted on jonolumb (at) gmail (dot) com. It's quite a nifty little
script and I have made small modifications to the origina code, but
since the original is no longer available to link or contribute to I
have decided to put it up on github under my account. 

Please use it at your own risk. No guarantee or waranty is provided with
this code.

Be Kind. :)

Goals:
Create an Amazon EC2 Fedora instance which is configured to run Apache
as a proxy server. 

Connect to Amazon EC2 instance via SSH and modify the Apache
configuration file to only allow the client's computer to connect to
the server. 

Restart Apache to apply changes.

(Optional) Assign an Amazon Elastic IP Address to the Instance which
can be used to access the HTTP Proxy. The script prints the IP address
assigned to the proxy server in the terminal â€“ this IP address can
then be pasted into your web browsers proxy configuration settings.

(Optional) Create a secure SSH HTTP Tunnel to the proxy server on port
9999. Clients can connect by changing browser network settings to a
SOCKS 5 proxy on localhost:9999.

The script then waits for keyboard input stop upon which the SSH HTTP
tunnel will be closed, the Amazon EC2 Instance shutdown and any Amazon
Elastic IP addresses released.
